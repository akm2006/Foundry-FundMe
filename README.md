# Foundry Fund Me 🚀

This repository contains a decentralized crowdfunding (FundMe) smart contract built with the **Foundry** development framework. The contract is written in **Solidity** and allows an owner to collect funds in ETH from anyone and withdraw them.

A key feature of this contract is its use of **Chainlink Price Feeds** to ensure that any funding transaction meets a minimum value specified in **USD**, making the funding goal independent of ETH's price volatility.

This project serves as a comprehensive exercise in smart contract development, testing, and deployment using modern Ethereum tools.

## 📄 Live Deployment

The smart contract has been successfully deployed and verified on the **Sepolia Testnet**.

- **Contract Address:** `0x6A4737FDa9c0c48d3666B94166c13669fe41Ae87`  
- **View on Etherscan:** [Sepolia Etherscan Link](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6A4737FDa9c0c48d3666B94166c13669fe41Ae87)

## ✨ Features

- **Fund Contract:** Anyone can send ETH to the contract.
- **Owner-Only Withdrawal:** Only the contract owner can withdraw the entire balance.
- **USD Value Minimum:** Enforces a minimum funding amount (e.g., $5) by using Chainlink Price Feeds to get the latest ETH/USD price.
- **Funder Tracking:** Keeps a record of all addresses that have funded the contract.
- **Optimized Gas:** Developed with gas efficiency in mind using modern Solidity patterns.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized as a standard Foundry project:

```

src/              --> Solidity source code
├── FundMe.sol              # Main crowdfunding contract
└── PriceConverter.sol      # Library for Chainlink price conversion

script/          --> Deployment and interaction scripts
└── DeployFundMe.s.sol      # Deployment script

test/            --> Smart contract test files
└── FundMeTest.t.sol        # Unit and integration tests

lib/             --> External dependencies (e.g., forge-std, chainlink-brownie-contracts)

broadcast/, cache/, out/  --> Foundry's default directories (ignored by Git)

Makefile         --> Shortcut commands for build/test/deploy
